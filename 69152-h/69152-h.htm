<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author of this Journal wrote it for his
own satisfaction. When he returned home,
he was induced to show it to a number of
his acquaintances for their information. Several,
on whose judgment he could rely, requested
him to publish it to the world. He
begs leave simply to remark that he was an
eye and ear witness to many things he has
narrated. He has represented things as he
understood and remembered them. Other
facts he obtained from testimony in which he
could fully confide. It is worthy of remark
that witnesses of probity, in giving their testimony
in courts respecting the same things,
often differ from one another as to many
circumstances, owing to their different capacities,
positions, and the like. It may be expected,
therefore, that some who were in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
army, may not exactly agree with the author
in all things stated in this Journal. Let that
be as it may, he is conscious that he sought
the most correct information, and that he
endeavored to communicate it in a plain,
perspicuous style. If he has made any important
mistakes, should those interested
convince him of them, in a friendly way, he
will use the best means in his power to correct
them.</p>

<p>As to the narratives subjoined to this
Journal, they are short, and he thinks, interesting.
He is acquainted with Mr. Davenport,
and believes him to be a man of veracity.
He had no acquaintance with Mr. Mallary
before he applied to him for his narrative.
His acquaintances will best know what credit
ought to be given to him.</p>

<p>The gentlemen who gave the narratives,
it is obvious, are the <i>only persons responsible
for the truth of them</i>.</p>

<p>The whole is, with diffidence, submitted to
the candor of a generous public, by</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JOURNAL OF THE CAMPAIGN,<br>

<i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few years past differences existed
between the United States of America and
the Kingdom of Great Britain. Every possible
means had been used on the part of the
executive and legislative departments of the
general government of the United States, to
adjust those differences upon honorable and
equitable terms. But Great Britain treated
every reasonable proposition with haughtiness
and contempt, and still persisted in violating
the just rights of the Americans, by
committing depredations on the high seas,
and by impressing the citizens of the United
States into the service of his Majesty, and
employing the savages to murder the defenceless
inhabitants of the frontiers. The United
States having long borne these outrages with
great patience, at length wearied with insults,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
resorted to the last and most painful alternative
of declaring war (which was done on
the 18th of June, 1812); and the government
having called for volunteers, more than the
quota of this State rallied round their country’s
standard, ready to assist in a vigorous
prosecution of the war, in order to hasten a
speedy and honorable peace.</p>

<p>General Hull having been appointed by
the general government to take possession of
part of Upper Canada, his forces, amounting
to about 3,000, not being considered sufficient
to execute that design, three regiments
of volunteer infantry and one regiment of
United States infantry, amounting in all to
about 2,300, were called and destined to his
assistance.</p>

<p>Agreeably to a general order, the following
regiments rendezvoused at Georgetown,
August 15, 1812, to wit:—</p>

<p>The first regiment was commanded by
Colonel John M. Scott, the fifth regiment was
commanded by Colonel William Lewis, the
first rifle regiment by Colonel John Allen,
the 17th United States regiment by Colonel
Samuel Wells; the whole under the command
of Brigadier-General Payne.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i> The troops paraded early in the
morning, and were received by Governor
Scott. We paraded again at 10 o’clock, and
marched to a convenient place in close order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
where the Rev. Mr. Blythe preached a short
sermon, and the Honorable Henry Clay delivered
an appropriate discourse.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i> The troops were inspected by Major
Garrard.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i> We drew two months’ pay in advance.
There being a general complaint
amongst the volunteers respecting sixteen
dollars, which were expected to be drawn in
lieu of clothing, Major Graves paraded his
battalion, and gave them their choice to go
on without the sixteen dollars, or return
home. <i>Six</i> chose to return; these, to fix an
odium upon them, were drummed out of
camp and through town.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i> We commenced our march in high
spirits to join General Hull at Detroit, or in
Canada. Each regiment, for convenience and
speed, marched separately to Newport. We
arrived at Newport the 24th; it is 80 miles
from Georgetown. It rained most of the
time, which made it disagreeable travelling
and encamping. These hardships tended a
little to quench the excessive patriotic flame
that had blazed so conspicuously at the different
musters and barbecues.</p>

<p>Here we received information of General
Hull having surrendered Detroit and Michigan
Territory to General Brock, on the 15th
of this instant, while in possession of the necessary
means to have held that post against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the forces of Upper Canada.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> This we could
not believe until confirmed by handbills and
good authority; when thus confirmed, it appeared
to make serious impressions on the
minds of officers and privates. Those high
expectations of participating with General
Hull in the laurels to be acquired by the
conquest of Malden and Upper Canada, were
entirely abandoned.</p>

<p>We drew our arms and accoutrements, and
crossed the Ohio on the 27th. Our destiny
was thought to be Fort Wayne.</p>

<p>The following general order will show
some of the evolutions which were performed
by this army while on its march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Headquarters</span>, <i>Cincinnati, August 23, 1812</i>.</p>

<p>“The troops will commence their march
in the direction to Dayton, by Lebanon, at
an early hour to-morrow morning. The
generale will be beat instead of the reveille;
the tents will then be struck, the baggage
loaded, and the line of march taken up as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>“The commandants of the several corps
will immediately commence drilling their
men to the performance of the evolutions
contemplated by the commander-in-chief, for
the order of march and battle. The principal
feature in all these evolutions is that of a
battalion changing its direction by swinging
on its centre. This, however, is not to be done
by wheeling, which, by a large body in the
woods, is impracticable. It is to be formed
thus: the battalion being on its march in a
single rank, and its centre being ascertained,
the front division comes to the right about,
excepting the man in the rear of that division
who steps two paces to the right, at the same
time the front man of the second division
takes a position about four feet to the left of
the man in the rear of the front division, and
dresses with him in a line at right angles to
the line of march. These two men acting as
marks or guides for the formation of the new
alignment at the word—Form the new alignment,
March! the men of the front division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
file round their guide, and form in succession
on his right. At the same time the men of
the rear division file up in succession to the
left of the guide, and dress in a line with him
and the guide of the front division. This
manœuvre may be performed by any number
of men, by company and platoon as well
as battalion.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Wm. H. Harrison</span>, &#160; &#160;<br>
“<i>Major-General Commanding</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><i>31st.</i> General Harrison overtook the army
between Lebanon and Dayton. He was received
joyfully by all the troops as commander-in-chief,
with three cheers.</p>

<p><i>September 1.</i> The army arrived at Dayton,
fifty miles from Cincinnati, and was saluted
by the firing of cannon. One of the men
who were firing the cannon got one of his
hands shot off, and the other badly wounded.
We arrived at Piqua, September 3, thirty
miles from Dayton, on the Big Miami.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i> Received information of the critical
situation of Fort Wayne. Colonel Allen’s<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
regiment and two companies from Colonel
Lewis’s, drew twenty-four rounds of ammunition,
and started with all possible speed to
the relief of that fort.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i> General Harrison having paraded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
remaining part of the army in a circle in close
order, delivered a speech to them, stating
that he had just received intelligence from
Fort Wayne; that it was in great danger of
being taken by the Indians and British; he
said that we were under the necessity of
making a forced march to their relief. He
read some of the articles of war, and stated
the absolute necessity of such regulations and
restrictions in an army, and if there were any
who could not feel willing to submit to those
articles and go on with him they might then
return home. <i>One man</i> belonging to Colonel
Scott’s regiment made a choice of returning
home, rather than submit to those terms.
Some of his acquaintances got a permit to
escort him part of the way home. Two of
them got him upon a rail and carried him to
the river; a crowd followed after; they ducked
him several times in the water, and washed
away all his patriotism.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i> We marched at 12 o’clock—we left
all our sick and part of our clothing and
baggage at Piqua, in order to make as much
speed as possible. On the morning of the
8th, three miles from St. Mary’s, one of Captain
M‘Gowen’s company was accidentally
shot through the body by one of the sentinels;
the surgeon thought it mortal.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
marched four miles and encamped near the
River St. Mary’s, one mile from the fort.
General Harrison called the army together
and stated, through emergency, we must be
on half rations of flour for a few days, but
should draw a ration and a half of beef, as
he wished to go as light and as quick as possible.
He said, “any who do not feel willing
to go on these terms may remain at the fort
and have plenty.” I know of none that
stayed. St. Mary’s block-house is thirty miles
from Piqua, on the River St. Mary’s.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i> We marched through some first-rate
woodland, and through a large prairie of the
best quality. It is badly watered; the water
in the wagon-ruts was the only drink we
could get to cool our scorching thirst, and
but very little of that. We encamped near
the River St. Mary’s, eighteen miles from the
fort. At 11 o’clock and at 3 we were alarmed
by the sentinels firing several guns; we
formed in order of battle, and stood so fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>The following extract of a general order is
designed to show the order of battle for night
and day attack.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Headquarters</span>, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>
“<i>Second Crossing of St. Mary’s, Sept. 10, 1812</i>.</p>

<p>“The signal for a general charge will be
beating the <i>long-roll</i>. Officers and men will
be upon their arms and in their clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Two or more guns firing in succession
will constitute an alarm, at which the whole
army will parade in the order of encampment
(that is, in a hollow square), unless
otherwise directed. When a sentinel discharges
his gun in the night the officer of
the guard to whom he belongs will immediately
ascertain the cause, and should he
have sufficient reason to believe, on an examination,
that an enemy is near, he will
cause two guns to be fired in quick succession.
Should the firing of a sentinel appear
to have proceeded from a cause not sufficient
to give an alarm, the officer of the guard will
immediately call out ‘<i>all is well</i>,’ which will
be repeated through the army. The same
thing will take place upon an accidental fire
made in the day.</p>

<p>“The order of battle for rear attack will
be so far attended with regard to the rear
line; the rear battalions of Colonel Lewis’s
regiment and Colonel Allen’s only are to
turn upon their centre, while the heads of
the front battalions are to close up the front
lines, then, facing from the centre, march out
until they respectively gain the flanks of the
front line. Should the attack be in front,
the senior officer nearest the flank battalion
will judge of the propriety of bringing up
that battalion to form on the flank of the
front line. The second battalion of Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Lewis’s and Colonel Allen’s regiments will,
in all cases, close up as the leading battalions
shall advance, and make room for them.
Captain Garrard’s troop, forming the rear
guard, will also close up and act as circumstances
may require.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Wm. H. Harrison</span>, &#160; &#160; <br >
“<i>Major-General Commanding</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><i>10th.</i> The order of march for the infantry
was as follows: the first and fifth regiments
formed one line in single file on the left, two
hundred yards from the road, the 17th United
States and the rifle regiments on the right in
the same manner. The baggage in the road.
The order of march for the horse troops:
One of Colonel Adams’s battalions of Ohio
volunteers was placed at the distance of half
a mile in front of the columns of infantry,
and marched in columns of companies in
files, and in such open order as to cover the
whole front of the army. The other battalion
of Ohio volunteers formed the right
flank guard of the army, at the distance of
three hundred yards from the column of infantry,
and parallel to it. The Kentucky
mounted riflemen on the left, the same distance
from the left column of infantry for
the left flank guard; Captain Garrard’s troop
formed the rear guard. We marched twelve
miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span><i>11th.</i> The spies wounded an Indian and
got his gun and blanket; our day’s march
was eleven miles; we stopped earlier than
usual in order to make breastworks, and because
it was a convenient place for water.
We fortified this place very strongly with
timber. At 11 o’clock the camp was alarmed
by the firing of many guns by the sentinels.
The whole army was formed in quick time,
the horse troops being in the centre ready
to assist any line or to obey any order which
might be given. One half of the men were
dismissed and retired to their tents for one
hour, then they relieved the first half. At 3
o’clock another alarm took place from the
sentinels, a general parade was again made.
We stood in order of battle for some time.
The watchword was “<i>fight on</i>,” after which
this place was called “Fort Fight On.”</p>

<p><i>12th.</i> We continued our march towards
Fort Wayne with as much caution as the
nature of our hurrying would admit; we expected
to meet with the enemy before we
reached the fort. In a certain well-known
swamp, through which we had to pass, we
thought probably the enemy would harbor.
We passed the swamp unmolested for a mile,
we were then alarmed. The rear battalions
formed in order of battle, but saw no enemy
to fight; we immediately resumed our march.
This alarm and the one the night preceding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
seemed to shake the boasted valor of some of
our bravest heroes.</p>

<p>This day’s march was twenty miles to
Fort Wayne, through a great deal of first-rate
land, rich, level, and well timbered, but
badly watered near the road; we suffered
extremely for water these three days. Our
arrival at this fort gave great joy to the inhabitants,
who were one company of regular
troops and a few families. The Indians had
closely invested the fort for several days, and
burned the United States factory and all the
other valuable houses which were not inside
of the stockading. Three of our men who
were caught out of the fort were killed by
the Indians. The Indians encamped about
the fort two weeks before they made the
attack on it, and were admitted in by Captain
Ray, the commanding officer of the garrison,
who would have surrendered to the savages,
had it not been for his lieutenant, who defended
the fort with great bravery. Three
Indians were killed and a few wounded.
Captain Ray was arrested and would have
been broken had he not resigned. The fort
was well provided for a siege, having in it
one hundred men, plenty of provisions, ammunition,
four small pieces of cannon, and a
good well of water.</p>

<p>Fort Wayne is one of the most elegant
situations I ever saw, and must be an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
place to the United States. Three
weeks ago the neighborhood around the fort
would have exhibited a pleasing prospect to
those who had seen nothing for several days
but a dreary wilderness of one hundred miles.
A number of well-cultivated farms, with neat
houses, in view of the fort, would have excited
emotions of pleasure. I suppose there
were four hundred acres of land in cultivation.
All the houses were reduced to ashes,
together with a large quantity of small grain
and hay, by the savages; they were principally
Pottowatomies; they also destroyed all
the stock of every kind about these farms,
which was very considerable. Fort Wayne
is situated on the south side of the River
Maumee, opposite the junction of the River
St. Mary’s and St. Joseph, which are considerable
navigable streams in lat. 41° 4′,
N. long. 11° 5′ west from the meridian of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>We were alarmed by the report of some
guns which were fired by the sentinels; we
formed in order of battle for half an hour,
during which time it rained very hard, and
rendered many of our guns unfit to do execution,
except the bayonets. The alarm must
have proceeded from the timidity of the
sentinels.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i> The whole force was divided and
placed under the command of General Payne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and Colonel Wells. General Payne’s command
was composed of Colonel Lewis’s regiment,
Colonel Allen’s and Captain Garrard’s
troop. Colonel Wells’s command was composed
of Colonel Scott’s regiment, the regulars
and the mounted riflemen. General
Payne was instructed to destroy the Miami
towns at the forks of the Wabash. Colonel
Wells was directed against the Pottowatomies’s
village at Elkheart. General Harrison
thought proper to go with General Payne;
so we proceeded on to the waters of the
Wabash; five miles from Fort Wayne we
encamped. Next morning we came to an
Indian hut and a small cornfield, two miles
from our encampment; here all the wagons
and baggage were left, and Captain Langhorne’s
company as a guard; from this place
we marched twenty-three miles to an Indian
town at the forks of the Wabash; we found
the town evacuated; we pulled down some
of their houses and built up fires and encamped;
we had plenty of roasting ears of
the best kind. It is a small kind of corn,
shallow grain, and very suitable for roasting
ears, which answered us a very good purpose,
as we had only a little provision with us.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i> We marched through their towns,
four in number, in the bounds of three or
four miles, in which there were fresh signs
of Indians. We cut up their corn and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
it in piles, sixty or eighty acres, so that it
might rot. A variety of beans were found
growing with their corn; potatoes, pumpkins,
water-melons, and cucumbers were also cultivated
by them. Their houses were all burnt
by the orders of General Harrison; some of
them were built of bark and some of logs.
The tomb of a chief was discovered; it was
built on the ground with timber and clay, so
that no rain or air could enter; the chief
was laid on his blanket, his head towards
sunrise, his rifle by his side, his tin pan on
his breast, with a spoon in it; he was ornamented
in their style, with ear-rings, brooches,
&amp;c. This is one of the most beautiful places
in the western country; the land is level,
well timbered, well watered, and the soil
equal to any part of Kentucky. Near the
town, where the timber has been cut, it is
covered with an elegant coat of blue grass.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i> We got back to the baggage, and
found all was well. Capt. Langhorne had fortified
against the enemy with rails, so that he
would have been able to have held his place
against a considerable force. We took some
refreshments and pursued our journey, and
encamped near our former encampment.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i> We arrived at Fort Wayne, and met
with a reinforcement of five hundred mounted
riflemen and cavalry, from Kentucky. A man
was accidentally shot through the head by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
one of the mounted riflemen. Colonel Wells’s
division returned this evening from their
route, which was fifty miles from Fort
Wayne, on the waters of St. Joseph’s River,
very much fatigued. They found nothing
but deserted houses and corn to destroy,
which was about the same amount as was
found at the Wabash. Capt. Morris’s 1st
sergeant (David Irwin) died on the road.
One of the light-horsemen wounded a man
as he was feeding his horse, believing him to
be an Indian.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i> We encamped in the forks of the
river half a mile from the fort. Gen. Harrison
not being legally authorized by the general
government, as commander of this army,
the command, of course, devolved on Winchester.
This resignation of Gen. Harrison’s
was done with much reluctance, as he had
placed great confidence in the Kentuckians,
and found he was their choice, in preference
to Gen. Winchester. The conduct of Gen.
Harrison at Tippecanoe, and his familiarity
with the troops while on their march to this
place, had gained to him a peculiar attachment.
Gen. Winchester being a stranger,
and having the appearance of a supercilious
officer, he was generally disliked. His assuming
the command almost occasioned a
mutiny in camp; this was prevented by the
solicitations of some of the officers to go on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span><i>20th.</i> The Kentucky mounted riflemen
started to St. Mary’s under the command of
Gen. Harrison, in order to pursue the Indians
in some other quarter; their number was
about fifteen hundred.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i> We received marching orders to
march to-morrow morning at 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>The following general order, will show
Gen. Winchester’s order of march.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">General Orders.</span>—<i>Fort Wayne Sept. 22, 1812.</i></p>

<p>“The army will march in the following
order, to wit: the guard in front in three
lines, two deep in the road, and in Indian
file on the flanks, at the distance of fifty to
one hundred yards from the centre line,
when not prevented by obstructions.</p>

<p>“A fatigue party, to consist of one captain,
one ensign, two sergeants, two corporals, and
fifty privates, will follow the front guard for
the purpose of opening the road. The remainder
of the infantry to march on the flanks
in the following order; Col. Wells’s and Allen’s
regiments on the right, and Scott’s and
Lewis’s on the left.</p>

<p>“The general and brigade baggage, commissaries’
and quartermasters’ stores immediately
in the rear of the fatigue party.
The cavalry in the following order: Capt.
Garrard and twenty of his men to precede<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the guard in front, and equally divide at the
head of each line. A lieutenant and eighteen
men in rear of the whole army and baggage.
The balance of the cavalry equally divided
on the flanks of the flank lines.</p>

<p>“The regimental baggage wagons fall in
according to the rank of the commanding
officers of the respective regiments. The
officers commanding corps, previous to their
marching, will cause the arms and ammunition
to be carefully examined, and will see
that they are in <i>good order</i>. They will also
be particularly careful that the men do not
waste their cartridges. No muskets are to
be carried in the wagons. One half of the
fatigue party are to work at the same time;
the other half are to carry the arms and accoutrements
while on fatigue. The wagon-master
will attend to the loading of the wagons,
and see that the different articles are
put in in good order, and that each wagon and
team carry a reasonable load. The hour of
march is deferred until 9 o’clock, instead of
7. The officer of the day is charged with the
execution of these orders.</p>

<p>“The line of battle shall be formed agreeably
to Gen. Harrison’s order on his late
march to Fort Wayne.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">James Winchester</span>, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br>
“<i>Brigadier-General</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span><i>26th.</i> Two white men, and Capt. John
(an Indian who was with us), lost their
horses. They continued about the camping
ground in search of them; they saw two or
three Indians exploring our encampment.
They took this method, no doubt, to calculate
our number. The spies returned to camp
this evening, who had discovered many Indian
signs in front. Five of the spies who had
yesterday started with the view to go to
Fort Defiance, were found on the road shot,
scalped, and tomahawked by the Indians or
British.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i> The spies and Capt. Garrard’s troop
started this morning to bury the dead. They
were attacked by a party of Indians who
were watching the dead. One of the spies
got shot in the ankle by an Indian. They
fired on the Indians, and with the assistance
of Capt. Garrard, they made them run, but
not without the loss of some of their savage
blood. It was supposed some of them were
badly wounded.</p>

<p>Capts. Hickman and Ruddell returned,
who had started this morning to reconnoitre
Fort Defiance. They reported, that they
saw many fresh signs of Indians. As they
returned to camp they spied an encampment
of Indians; the Indians were talking and
laughing merrily. A detachment was sent
after dark in order to surprise them. Ruddell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
their pilot, got lost before he got far,
so that they could not execute their design.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i> The army was alarmed about a mile
from camp; we quickly paraded in order of
battle, and were anxious to meet the enemy.
The alarm proceeded from the spies, who
fired at some Indians in front. The spies
returned to camp this evening; they saw
where a large number of Indians and British
had encamped the night before.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i> We continued on the same encampment,
five miles from Defiance, and forty-five
from Fort Wayne. The spies and horse
troop were sent out in order to make discoveries.
A party took the back track; they
saw where the enemy had wheeled to the
right about, and retreated; and fortunately
for them they did so. Our industry in fortifying
the camp with breastworks, and caution
and vigilance with which it was guarded,
would have rendered us able to have maintained
our ground against a superior force.
Wagon tracks were plainly to be seen—it
was thought they were going to Fort Wayne
with cannon, to take that place.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i> We marched within one mile of Fort
Defiance, and searched for a suitable place to
encamp on: after every examination it was
thought best to continue here, as it was a convenient
place for timber. We pitched our
tents and built very strong breastworks round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the camp, which we had done for five or six
nights past; we also slept with our guns in
our arms, and paraded an hour before day,
and stood under arms till nearly sunrise.
From Fort Wayne to Defiance, we travelled
on the north-west side of the Maumee River.
The country is extremely level and well
timbered, but badly watered.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 1.</i> Col. Lewis, with a detachment of
three hundred and eighty men, started early
this morning to pursue the Indians and British;
they crossed the Auglaze River, and proceeded
down the Maumee seven or eight
miles, but could see nothing more than the
appearance of the enemy retreating.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i> Gen. Harrison arrived here with about
one hundred mounted troops, and two days’
rations of flour. We have been without
bread four days. We were informed Gen.
Harrison was appointed commander-in-chief
of the North-Western Army; this was pleasing
news to their troops, as he was the choice
in preference to any other.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i> The troops that were with Gen. Harrison,
consisting of mounted riflemen and
cavalry, three regiments, came to camp this
morning from St. Mary’s, which is 63 miles
from Defiance. They came with speed, to
assist the troops commanded by Gen. Winchester.
Gen. Harrison had received information
that all the British and Indian forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of Upper Canada were on their way to meet
Gen. Winchester at Defiance.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i> There has been great murmuring in
camp, on account of the scarcity of provisions,
which threatened a dissolution of this
army. Gen. Harrison having paraded the
army, addressed them and said, there were
twenty-five thousand rations provided for
this army at St. Mary’s; this should be conveyed
here as soon as possible, part of which
would be here to-day; he stated the consequence
of such mutinous complaints, and if
this army would disperse, where could he
get men who would stand? He said every
exertion for the supply of this army with
provisions and clothing, should be used.
He informed us there would be a number of
troops from Pennsylvania and Virginia to
join us, amounting in all to ten thousand.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i> A fatigue party of two hundred and
forty men were employed to rebuild Fort Defiance.
There were a few men on the other
side of the river opposite to the fort. They discovered
a party of Indians, twenty or thirty
in number; they took them to be those
friendly Indians who were with us; being
not on their guard, they got close to them.
Four or five of the Indians fired at the same
time; they killed and scalped one of the men,
and made their escape. The murder was
committed not more than three hundred yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
from the encampment of the mounted riflemen
and cavalry, with Gen. Tupper at the
head of them. Those murderers were pursued
immediately by two hundred horsemen; they
pursued them in scattered order. A small
party overtook them five or six miles from
camp, and finding the enemy’s force superior
they had to retreat.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i> The principal part of the clothing
which was left at Piqua, came to camp; it
has been greatly needed. A majority of the
mounted men who were ordered to the rapids,
and drew ten days’ provisions for <i>that expedition</i>,
refused to march under Gen. Tupper;
of course the contemplated expedition failed,
and they returned home, as their thirty days
were nearly expired.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i> A few days ago, Frederick Jacoby,
belonging to the 17th regiment of United
States infantry, was tried by a court-martial
for sleeping on his post—he was condemned
to be shot. The troops paraded and formed
in a hollow square in close order, where the
Rev. Mr. Shannon delivered a short discourse
on the occasion. The square was then displayed,
so that the army might witness the
awful example of execution. The criminal
was marched from the provost guard with
solemn music, under a guard of a subaltern,
sergeant, corporal, and twenty privates, to the
place of execution; there he was blindfolded;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the guard stood a few steps from him waiting
the hour of execution! This was a solemn
scene; a profound silence was kept by all the
troops. But fortunately for the criminal, a
reprieve arrived for him, just before the time
of execution! The General judged him not
a man of sound mind.</p>

<p>The spies reported they had killed an Indian,
but could not get his scalp on account
of other Indians; they stated there must be
a large body of Indians near, by their trails.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i> In consequence of the above report
of the spies, Colonel Wells started with five
hundred men in pursuit of the Indians; he
pursued their trails twelve or thirteen miles,
but could not see an Indian.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i> The General ordered we should move
and encamp near where the fort was building;
this was, however, prevented by the
inclemency of the weather; it rained and the
wind blew all day, which made our situation
very unpleasant. A man died in camp last
night; he was buried with the honors of war;
he was escorted to the grave in solemn order,
and, after a short discourse by the Rev. Mr.
Mitchell, six men fired three rounds over the
grave; this was the first scene of the kind
witnessed in our camp.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i> We moved to the fort, and received
a supply of provisions (salt, flour, and whiskey);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
we had been without salt ever since the
7th, and without flour two days.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i> A detachment of one hundred men
was sent this morning six miles below the
fort, to a suitable place of timber to build
pirogues.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i> (<i>Sunday.</i>) The troops marched to the
centre, agreeably to a general order, to hear
the Rev. Mr. Shannon preach a sermon suited
to the times. While he was zealously engaged
there were six or seven guns fired
down the river in quick succession; this
alarmed the whole congregation—every one
flew to his arms and left the speaker alone.
The alarm originated from a pirogue party,
who had just arrived with a pirogue for a
supply of provisions.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i> The fort was finished and christened
“<i>Fort Winchester</i>.” It is composed of four
block-houses, a hospital and storehouse, and
picketed between each block-house, containing
about a quarter of an acre.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i> The General issued an order for the
troops to be assembled every morning at 9
o’clock, at such places near the encampment,
as the commanding officers might deem convenient,
and cause the rolls to be called, and
mark all delinquents; and there, until 12
o’clock, practice the manual exercise, and
manœuvre according to Smith’s instructions
for infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span><i>27th.</i> In consequence of Gen. Winchester’s
receiving information, he issued an order respecting
clothing, which will show a flattering
prospect of being supplied, an extract of
which is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">General Orders.</span>—<i>Fort Winchester, Oct. 27, 1812.</i></p>

<p>“With great pleasure the General announces
to the army the prospect of an early
supply of winter clothing, amongst which are
the following articles exported from Philadelphia
on the 9th of September last, viz.
10,000 pairs of shoes, 5,000 blankets, 5,000
round jackets, 5,000 pairs of pantaloons,
woollen cloth, to be made and forwarded to
the westward immediately; besides the winter
clothing for Col. Wells’s regiment some
days before; 1,000 watch-coats, ordered from
Philadelphia the 7th of October, 1812. September
24th, 5,000 blankets and 1,000 yards
of flannel. 25th, 10,000 pairs of shoes. 29th,
10,000 pairs of woollen hose, 10,000 do. socks.</p>

<p>“Yet a few days and the General consoles
himself with the idea of seeing those whom
he has the honor to command clad in warm
woollen, capable of resisting the <i>northern blasts
of Canada</i>.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">J. Winchester</span>, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>
“<i>Brigadier-Gen. Commanding Left Wing N. W. Army</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><i>29th.</i> A fatigue party, consisting of three
captains, three subalterns, three sergeants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
three corporals, and one hundred and fifty
privates was detached this morning, superintended
by Gen. Payne, to clear the way on
the opposite side of the river, so as to make
the view more extensive from the fort. The
spies caught a prisoner fifteen or twenty
miles below this place; he said he was just
from Detroit; he was suspected as a spy, but
he denied it; he said he deserted from the
British, who had had him in confinement
some time in consequence of his not taking
the oath to be true to them.</p>

<p>Fort Winchester is situated near the point
between the Maumee and Auglaze rivers,
and is a handsome place; it is predicted by
some to become in a few years a populous
city. The greater part of the land in the
adjacent country is rich, and when improved
will be equal, if not superior, to any in the
western country. The Auglaze River empties
into Great Miami, which runs a north course
to Fort Winchester, and is navigable a considerable
distance.</p>

<p><i>November 2.</i> We moved across the River
Maumee, opposite the point; it is a high
piece of ground and very level, but in some
degree wet and marshy: this movement was
in order to get convenient to firewood.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i> This late place of encampment is found
not to answer a good purpose; therefore the
General thought it expedient to move from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
this to a piece of ground one-half mile lower
down the river. As there were only a few
wagons, one regiment moved at a time—from
12 o’clock till after sunset before the last arrived
at the place of destination. This last
place appears to be very marshy, but not so
much so as the former. It is very difficult
to get a good place for an encampment at
this time, as we have had several rainy days.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i> The troops have been engaged in fortifying
this late place of encampment with
breastworks, so that we may be prepared for
our enemies, should they think proper to pay
us a visit; the weather is very rainy, which
makes our situation extremely unpleasant,
though not more so than we could expect
from the climate and season. Four of this
army have gone to the silent tomb to-day,
never more to visit their friends in Kentucky;
the fever is very prevalent in camp; nearly
every day there is one or more buried.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i> We received information from Kentucky
by passengers, of a quantity of clothing
coming out for the volunteers. By every account
from that quarter, the roads are almost
impassable. Major Garrard, and six of the
spies, started to the Rapids this morning.
This river abounds greatly with fish; large
quantities have been caught with traps, and
also with hooks and lines.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i> Major Garrard, and those men with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
him, returned from the Rapids. They made
discoveries of a large quantity of corn, and
some hogs, and cattle, and a few Indians.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i> The army moved six miles down the
river, in order to be better accommodated
with suitable ground for camping, and to
build more pirogues. This encampment is
the dryest we have been at for some time;
the land and timber are not inferior to any.
I trust this country was designed for a more
noble purpose than to be a harbor for those
rapacious savages, whose manners and deportment
are not more elevated than the
ravenous beasts of the forest. I view the
time not far distant, when this country will
be interspersed with elegant farms and flourishing
towns, and be inhabited by a free
and independent people, under an auspicious
republic.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i> A detachment of six captains, six
subalterns, six sergeants, six corporals, and
three hundred and eighty-six privates, started
with six days’ provision, this morning, at
reveille beating, to the Rapids, under the
command of Col. Lewis.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i> Col. Lewis, with his detachment, returned
about twelve o’clock, after a laborious
march of sixty miles. About eighteen miles
below this place, he was overtaken by an express
from Gen. Winchester, who had received
intelligence of Gen. Tupper, with five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
hundred men, being at the Rapids, who had
discovered a body of Indians, six or seven
hundred in number, drinking and dancing.
Gen. Tupper, thinking this a good opportunity
to attack them, attempted to cross the
river, two miles above; he and two hundred
of his men effected this, through great difficulty;
in wading across some fell in the
water and lost their guns, which discouraged
the rest, so that Gen. Tupper could not execute
his design. This intelligence animated the
troops commanded by Col. Lewis, so that
they wanted to continue on that night, without
stopping, and attack the enemy before
day. Col. Lewis thought proper to halt, and
send an express to Gen. Tupper, for both
parties to meet at Roche de Baut,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> six miles
above the Indian encampment, and unite
their forces, and surprise the enemy.</p>

<p>The express returned at three o’clock in
the morning, and reported, he had been at
Gen. Tupper’s encampment; at the entrance
of which, he saw a man, dead, scalped, and
stripped. He concluded that Gen. Tupper
was defeated. This news changed the course
of Col. Lewis, not knowing their force. The
General has thought proper to have this place
strongly fortified with breastworks, four and
a half feet high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span><i>18th.</i> One of the sentinels of the bullock
guard discharged the contents of his gun at
an Indian, as he thought, a few miles below
camp, where the bullocks were grazing; the
guard deserted the bullocks, and retreated to
camp. A party was immediately sent in pursuit
of the Indians, and behold! they found
Michael Paul cutting a bee-tree.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i> Ruddell returned, who was sent on
the <i>17th</i> to reconnoitre the Rapids, and Tupper’s
encampment. He discovered a large
body of Indians at the Rapids. He was
through Tupper’s encampment, where it was
supposed he was defeated He saw the man
that was scalped and stripped, and he thought
Tupper had retreated, instead of being defeated.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i> Smith and his party of spies had a
little skirmish near Wolftown. Early in the
morning they were eating their breakfasts;
one of them started to get a drink of water;
he had only got a few steps when an Indian
fired and wounded him, but not mortally.
After snapping twice, he fired and wounded
an Indian. Several guns were fired by the
Indians afterwards, but no injury was sustained.
In returning to camp the wounded
man was sent on some distance before, while
part of them remained in the rear as a guard.</p>

<p>Capt. Logan, Capt. John, and another Indian,
started to the Rapids with the determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to establish their characters (for they were
suspected by some to be traitors). Between
this and the Rapids, as they were rising a
bank, they met seven Indians and a British
officer, who took them prisoners, but let
them carry their own guns. After taking
them some considerable distance, they were
determined to liberate themselves or fall a
sacrifice. They succeeded in killing at the
same time, the British officer<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> and two of
the Indians; they stated Logan killed the
second, but he got badly wounded through the
body; one of the other Indians that were with
him got wounded, but not mortally. The
two wounded got on two horses that belonged
to the dead and rode to camp, leaving Capt.
John to take scalps.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i> Capt. John came in camp this morning
with a scalp; he said it was the scalp of a
Pottowatomie chief (Wynemack); he broke
his knife in scalping him, which prevented
him from scalping the others.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i> Logan died, and was much lamented
by the men generally, believing him to be
true to the United States, and a brave soldier.</p>

<p><i>December 1.</i> The troops are engaged in
building huts, which are far preferable to
tents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span><i>2d.</i> The General has issued an order for the
camp to be picketed, which is three-quarters
of a mile round. It is on the north side of
the river, and is composed of three lines.
Col. Wells’s regiment on the right, Col.
Scott’s, Lewis’s, and part of Allen’s in front,
the remaining part of Allen’s on the left, the
river in the rear. The pickets were nearly
completed in one day, two feet in the ground
and eight feet above.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i> The General has given orders to the
commanding officers of regiments to cause
each of their companies to be provided with
a good pirogue sufficient to carry its own
baggage, and cause all those who are without
shoes to make themselves moccasons out of
green hides.</p>

<p>There are many who have not shoes and
clothes sufficient to keep them from freezing,
should we move from here while they are in
this condition; the clothes that the General
flattered us with the expectation, and the
clothes subscribed by the Kentuckians being
not yet received, except a small part of the
latter.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i> Smith and his party returned from
the Rapids, who started two days ago in a
canoe; they did not go far before they left
the canoe, on account of the ice, and travelled
by land; some of them were dangerously
frostbitten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span><i>14th.</i> An express arrived in camp, certifying
that the boats which started from St.
Mary’s on the 4th, laden with flour and
clothing, were frozen up in St. Mary’s River,
and the escort was building a house to store
the loading in.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i> Capt. Hickman started this morning
to forward flour and clothing immediately on
packhorses.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i> We have drawn no flour since the
10th, in consequence of which there was a
letter handed to the General last night secretly,
which stated that the volunteers in
two days, except flour came before that time,
would start and go to it; and they would
carry their camp equipage to the fort if the
General required it. This news was soon
circulated through camp. The officers used
every argument to suppress the appearance
of a mutiny. A court-martial was held at
Capt. Williams’s marquee to try John Hoggard,
a private in Capt. Price’s company, for
some misdemeanor. He was condemned to be
drummed out of camp. Col. Lewis paraded
his regiment, and had him escorted with the
fife and drum from one end of his line to the
other. So he was legally discharged from
the army. The most common punishment
in camp for criminals is that of <i>riding the
wooden horse</i>, or being put <i>under guard on
half rations</i>. All the beef and pork was issued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
to the troops this evening; our dependence
for the next ration is on a drove of hogs that
has been expected several days!</p>

<p><i>17th.</i> Three hundred head of hogs arrived
to our relief.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i> The weather is excessively cold; the
ice has stopped the navigation of the river,
so that the plan of going to the Rapids by
water is entirely frustrated; we had prepared
about sixty pirogues for the voyage, which
will be left here for our successors.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i> The General has ordered the commandants
of regiments to cause each company
to be provided with a sufficient number
of sleds to convey their baggage to the
Rapids. It is said these sleds are to be pulled
by the men, as we have not a horse in camp
able to pull an empty sled.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i> A little flour came to camp once
more; quarter-rations of that article were
issued, which was welcomed by rejoicing
throughout camp:</p>

<p><i>24th.</i> Capt. Hickman returned with joyful
news—that we should in a short time be supplied
with flour. The deficiency of this article
had produced serious consequences in
the army. We have here been exposed to
numberless difficulties, as well as deprived
of the common necessaries of life; and what
made these things operate more severely was,
all hopes of obtaining any conquest was entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
abandoned. Obstacles had emerged in
the path to victory, which must have appeared
insurmountable to every person endowed
with common sense. The distance to
Canada, the unpreparedness of the army, the
scarcity of provisions, and the badness of the
weather, show that Malden cannot be taken
in the remaining part of our time. And
would it not have been better if this army
had been disbanded? Our sufferings at this
place have been greater than if we had been
in a severe battle. More than one hundred
lives have been lost, owing to our bad accommodations!
The sufferings of about three
hundred sick at a time, who are exposed to
the cold ground and deprived of every nourishment,
are sufficient proofs of our wretched
condition! The camp has become a loathsome
place. The hope of being one day
relieved from these unnecessary sufferings
affords some relief. We received this evening
a supply of flour, and have been delivered
from a state of starvation. It being Christmas
eve, just after dark, a number of guns
were fired in quick succession; the whole
army was ordered to parade in order of battle;
strict orders were given to suppress
the firing. About an hour before day the
firing commenced again; the army was again
paraded and strict orders given, threatening
to punish the offenders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span><i>27th.</i> Part of the clothing arrived from
Kentucky.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i> We are now about commencing one
of the most serious marches ever performed
by the Americans. Destitute, in a measure,
of clothes, shoes, and provisions, the most
essential articles necessary for the existence
and preservation of the human species in this
world, and more particularly in this cold
climate. Three sleds are prepared for each
company, each to be pulled by a packhorse,
which has been without food for two weeks,
except brush, and will not be better fed while
in our service; probably the most of these
horses never had harness on, but the presumption
is they will be too tame; we have
prepared harness out of green hides.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i> After nearly three months’ preparation
for this expedition, we commenced our
march in great splendor; our elegant equipage
cast a brilliant lustre on the surrounding
objects as it passed! our clothes and
blankets looked as if they had never been
acquainted with water, but intimately with
dirt, smoke, and soot; in fact, we have become
acquainted with one much despised in
Kentucky, under whose government we are
obliged to live, whose name is “<i>Poverty</i>.”
We marched six miles and encamped near
Col. Wells’s regiment, which marched yesterday;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the sick were left at No. Third, with a
company from each regiment as a guard.</p>

<p><i>January 10.</i> We arrived at Hull’s road at
the Rapids, fifty miles from Fort Defiance,
and encamped on a very high and suitable
piece of ground. The second day after we
left No. Third, the snow melted and the
ground thawed, which operated much against
our march. We marched two miles, which
tried the strength and activity of our noble
steeds. The General, who remained behind
at No. Third, more properly styled <i>Fort
Starvation</i>, thinking probably to take the advantage
of the weather (this moderate thaw
had opened the river in a ripple opposite to
No. Third), had several pirogues loaded with
his baggage, and manned immediately. After
travelling three or four hundred yards
they found that they were blockaded with
ice; they landed and guarded the plunder,
until arrangements could be made for
its transportation by land. The weather
took a change the second of January. It
commenced snowing, and continued two days
and nights: after it ceased, it was from twenty
to twenty-four inches deep. During this
time we remained stationary. On the third
the army resumed its march, wading through
a deep snow. We had to stop early in the
afternoon to prepare our encampment; to
rake the snow away, make fires, and pitch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
our tents, was no trifling task; and after this
we had to get bark or bushes to lie on; the
linn, in this case, was of great service to us.
Many of the horses gave out, and sleds broke
down; consequently, the plunder had to be
pulled or carried by the men. I have seen
six Kentuckians substituted instead of a horse,
pulling their plunder, drudging along through
the snow, and keeping pace with the foremost.
In marching to this place we came
through some good land, particularly the
river bottoms, which are very rich. Wolftown,
which is about half way between Fort
Defiance and the Rapids, is a handsome
situation. This has formerly been an Indian
town. We reached Roche De Baut the 9th,
four miles above Hull’s road, a place where
some French had formerly lived. Early
next morning (as cold a morning as the
Kentuckians ever experienced) a detached
party of six hundred and seventy-six men
marched in front of the baggage, and went
on four miles below the foot of the Rapids,
in order to examine if it were true, as said
by some passengers from the right wing of
the army, that there were six hundred Indians
encamped and picketed in, six miles below
the Rapids. The detachment marched within
two miles of the place, and sent spies, but
they discovered no signs of Indians. The
party remained all night, and partook of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
elegant supper of parched corn, and returned
to camp in the morning.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i> Some fresh signs of Indians were
seen near this encampment. A detachment of
twenty-four men was sent immediately, under
the command of Capt. Williams. They had
not got far before they discovered the Indians;
the firing commenced on both sides
nearly at the same time. The Indians stood
but a little time before they ran, but not
until they lost some of their savage blood.
Capt. Williams pursued them some miles,
but could not overtake them. By the signs
of blood, some of them must have been badly
wounded. They left behind them two of
their horses, a brass kettle, and some other
plunder. One of Capt. Williams’s men received
a wound in the arm, and another got
shot through his hat. Capt. Edmiston, who
was one of the party, got his gun shot through
the breech.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i> Two Frenchmen came in camp last
night from the river Raisin, who received information
of the army being here by those
Indians that Capt. Williams pursued, who
got there the night after the skirmish, and
stopped only a few minutes, and then went
on to Malden. Those Frenchmen solicited
protection and assistance, stating the abuse
they had received from the Indians, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
danger they were in of losing their lives and
property.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i> Arrived in camp this morning, clothing
from Kentucky. The ladies who sent
this clothing deserve the highest encomiums.
If it had not been for their unexampled exertions,
we must have suffered beyond conception.
May they long live under the auspicious
protection of a free government, and
may kind heaven reward their unparalleled
benevolence!</p>

<p>Another Frenchman came to camp, confirming
what was stated by the others. We
now began to recruit after our laborious
march, and after being deprived of a sufficiency
of provisions. Although we have
been without flour ever since we came here,
yet we have been better supplied with provisions
than we have been since we embarked
in the service. We have here in possession
many large fields of corn, probably three
hundred acres. We have erected a great
many pounding machines, to prepare it for
our use. This place has a solemn appearance.
The inhabitants have fled, and the
Indians or British have burned their houses,
leaving some of the chimneys standing. By
every appearance, this has been a respectable
settlement. Four miles below our encampment,
are the remains of the old British garrison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span><i>17th.</i> A Frenchman came yesterday from
the river Raisin; he said two companies of
British had just arrived from Canada, and
the Indians were collecting, and intended to
burn Frenchtown in a few days. By the
repeated solicitations of the French, and being
counselled by some of the field-officers, the
General has been induced to order out a detachment
of five hundred and seventy men,
destined to the river Raisin; it was said, contrary
to the instructions of Gen. Harrison.
The detachment started<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> early with three
days’ provisions, and proceeded on twenty
miles near to Presqu’ Isle, a French village
on the south side of the Maumee River. The
sight of this village filled each heart with
emotions of cheerfulness and joy; for we had
been nearly five months in the wilderness,
exposed to every inconvenience, and excluded
from everything that had the appearance
of a civilized country. When the inhabitants
of the village discovered us, they
met us with a white flag, and expressed particular
friendship for us. They informed us
the British and Indians had left Frenchtown
a few days ago, and had gone to Brownstown.
About three hours after dark, a reinforcement
of one hundred and ten men overtook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
us, commanded by Col. Allen. Some time in
the latter part of the night an express came
from the river Raisin, informing Col. Lewis
there were four hundred Indians and two
companies of British there, and that Colonel
Elliott was to start the next morning from
Malden with a reinforcement.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i> We started early, in order to get
there before Col. Elliott; after travelling fifteen
miles, mostly on the ice, we received
information of the enemy being there waiting
for us; we were then within three miles of
Frenchtown; we proceeded on with no other
view than <i>to conquer or die</i>. When we advanced
in sight of the town, and were about
a quarter of a mile from it, the British saluted
us by the firing of a piece of cannon; they
fired it three times, but no injury was sustained.
During this time we formed the line
of battle, and, raising a shout,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> advanced on
them briskly; they soon commenced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
firing of their small arms, but this did not
deter us from a charge; we advanced close
and let loose on them; they gave way, and
we soon had possession of the village without
the loss of a man! Three were slightly
wounded. Twelve of their warriors were slain
and scalped, and one prisoner taken before
they got to the woods. In retreating, they
kept up some firing. We pursued them half a
mile to the woods, which were very brushy
and suited to their mode of fighting. As we
advanced, they were fixing themselves behind
logs, trees, &amp;c. to the best advantage; our
troops rushed on them resolutely, and gave
them Indian play, took the advantage of
trees, &amp;c. and kept them retreating a mile
and a half in the woods. During this time a
heavy fire was kept up on both sides; at
length, after a battle of three hours and five
minutes, we were obliged to stop the pursuit
on account of the approach of night, and retire
to the village; we collected our wounded
and carried them to the village, leaving our
dead on the ground. In this action the Kentuckians
displayed great bravery, after being
much fatigued with marching on the ice;
cowardice was entirely discountenanced; each
was anxious to excel his fellow-soldiers in
avenging his injured country; those only fell
in the rear who were most fatigued. Our loss
in this action was eleven killed and fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
wounded.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> Although the enemy had the
advantage of the village in the first attack,
and of the woods in the second, their loss, by
the best information, far exceeded ours. A
Frenchman stated they had fifty-four killed
and a hundred and forty wounded, part of
whom were carried to his house, on Sand
Creek, a few miles from the village. An express
and the Indian prisoner were sent immediately
to the Rapids. Some dispute arose
between the Indians and some of the French
on Sand Creek; the Indians killed an old
man and his wife; in consequence of this the
French were enraged, and resolved to get
revenge. They applied to us for assistance,
but it was thought improper to leave the
village, though some of them had assisted us
and fought in the front of the battle.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i> A party was sent out to the battle-ground
to bring in the dead, which were
found scalped and stripped except one. In
going over the battle-ground, great signs were
seen (by the blood and where they had been
dragged through the snow) of a considerable
loss on the part of the enemy. Two of the
wounded died. The British left a considerable
quantity of provisions and some store<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
goods, which answered us a valuable purpose.
The wounded could have been as well
accommodated here with every necessary as
in any part of Kentucky. Apples, cider, sugar,
butter, and whiskey appeared to be plenty.
The river Raisin runs an east course through
a level country, interspersed with well-improved
farms, and is seventy or eighty yards
wide; the banks are low. Frenchtown is
situated on the north side of this river, not
more than three miles from the place it empties
into Lake Erie. There is a row of dwelling-houses,
about twenty in number, principally
frame, near the bank, surrounded with
a fence made in the form of picketing, with
split timber, from four to five feet high; this
was not designed as a fortification, but to
secure their yards and gardens.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i> A reinforcement of two hundred and
thirty men arrived in the afternoon; also
Gen. Winchester, Col. Wells, Major M‘Clanahan,
Capt. Hart, surgeons Irvin and Montgomery,
and some other gentlemen, who
came to eat apples and drink cider, having
been deprived of every kind of spirits nearly
two months. The officers having viewed and
laid off a piece of ground for a camp and
breastworks, resolved that it was too late to
remove and erect fortifications that evening;
farther, as they resolved to remove early
next day, it was not thought worth while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
though materials were at hand, to fortify the
right wing, which therefore encamped in the
open field,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> and Col. Wells, their commander,
set out for the Rapids late in the evening. A
Frenchman arrived here late in the evening
from Malden, and stated that a large number
of Indians and British were coming on the
ice with artillery to attack us; he judged
their number to be three thousand; this was
not believed by some of our leading men,
who were regaling themselves with whiskey
and loaf sugar; but the generality of the
troops put great confidence in the Frenchman’s
report, and expected some fatal disaster
to befall us; principally because Gen.
Winchester had taken up his head-quarters
nearly half a mile from any part of the encampment,
and because the right wing was
exposed. Ensign Harrow was sent with a
party of men, some time after night, by the
orders of Col. Lewis, to bring in all the men,
either officers or privates, that he might find
out of their quarters. After finding some and
giving them their orders, he went to a brick
house, about a mile up the river, and entered
a room; finding it not occupied, he immediately
went above stairs and saw two men,
whom he took to be British officers, talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
with the landlord. The landlord asked him
to walk down into a stove room, and handing
his bottle, asked him to drink, and informed
him “there was no danger, for the British
had not a force sufficient to whip us.” So
Harrow returned about 1 o’clock and reported
to Col. Lewis what he had seen. Col.
Lewis treated the report with coolness, thinking
the persons seen were only some gentlemen
from town; just at daybreak the reveille
began to beat, as usual; this gave joy to the
troops, who had passed the night under the
apprehensions of being attacked before day.
The reveille had not been beating more than
two minutes before the sentinels fired three
guns in quick succession; this alarmed our
troops, who quickly formed and were ready
for the enemy before they were near enough
to do execution. The British immediately
discharged their artillery, loaded with balls,
bombs, and grape-shot, which did little injury;
they then attempted to make a charge
on those in the pickets, but were repulsed
with great loss. Those on the right being less
secure for the want of fortification, were overpowered
by a superior force, and were ordered
to retreat to a more advantageous
piece of ground. They got in disorder and
could not be formed.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> The Indians pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
them from all quarters, and surrounded,
killed, and took the most of them. The enemy
again charged on the left with redoubled
vigor, but were again forced to retire. Our
men lay close behind the picketing, through
which they had portholes, and every one
having a rest took sight, that his ammunition
might not be spent in vain. After a long
and bloody contest, the enemy finding they
could not, either by stratagem or force, drive
us from our fortification, retired to the woods,
leaving their dead on the ground, except a
party that kept two pieces of cannon in play
on our right. A sleigh was seen three or four
hundred yards from our lines going towards
the right, supposed to be laden with ammunition
to supply the cannon. Four or five
men rose up and fired at once, and killed the
man and wounded the horse. Some Indians
who were hid behind houses continued to
annoy us with scattering balls. At this time
bread from the commissary’s house was
handed round among our troops, who sat
composedly eating and watching the enemy
at the same time. Being thus refreshed, we
discovered a white flag advancing toward us;
it was generally supposed to be for a cessation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
of arms that our enemies might carry
off their dead, which were numerous, although
they had been bearing away both
dead and wounded during the action; but
how were we surprised and mortified when we
heard that Gen. Winchester, with Col. Lewis,
had been taken prisoners by the Indians in
attempting to rally the right wing, and that
Gen. Winchester had surrendered us prisoners
of war to Col. Proctor! Major Madison,
then the highest in command, did not agree
to this until Col. Proctor had promised<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> that
the prisoners should be protected from the
Indians, the wounded taken care of, the dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
collected and buried, and private property
respected. It was then with extreme reluctance
our troops accepted this proposition;
there was scarcely a person that could refrain
from shedding tears! Some plead with the
officers not to surrender, saying they would
rather die on the field! We had only five
killed, and twenty-five or thirty wounded,
inside of the pickets. The British asked,
when they came in, what we had done with
our dead, as they saw but few on the ground.
A barn being set on fire to drive the Indians
from behind it, they concluded that, to conceal
our dead, we had thrown them into these
flames.</p>

<p>One of the houses that the wounded were
in, was much shattered by the cannon balls,
though only a few struck as low as a man’s
head. The bombs flew over. Some bursted
fifty feet above the ice, some fell on the ice,
and some fell over the river. Notwithstanding
all their exertions, their six cannon
(which were all said to be six-pounders) did
but little damage.</p>

<p>In this battle, officers and privates exhibited
the utmost firmness and bravery.
Whilst the men were at their posts firing on
the enemy, the officers were passing along
the lines supplying them with cartridges.
Major Graves, in passing around the line,
was wounded in the knee. He sat down in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
a tent, bound up his wound, and cried:
“<span class="smcap">Boys, I am wounded; never mind me, but
fight on!</span>”</p>

<p>The British collected their troops, and
marched in front of the village. We marched
out and grounded our arms, in heat and bitterness
of spirit. The British and Indians
took possession of them. But all the swords,
dirks, tomahawks, and knives were given up
with promise that they should be restored
again. [This promise was broken.]</p>

<p>All the prisoners, except those that were
badly wounded, Dr. Todd, Dr. Bowers, and a
few attendants, were marched towards Malden.
The British said, as they had a great
many of their wounded to take to Malden
that evening, it would be out of their power
to take ours before morning, but they would
leave a sufficient guard, so that they should
not be interrupted by the Indians. You will
presently see with what aggravating circumstances
the breach of this promise was attended.</p>

<p>Brother Allen Darnall having been badly
wounded in the right shoulder on the 18th,
and I being appointed to attend on the
wounded, I continued with them.</p>

<p>Before the British and prisoners marched,
the Indians ransacked the camp, and got all
the plunder that was remaining—namely,
tents, kettles, buckets, pans, &amp;c.; then coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
amongst the wounded, greatly insulted them,
and took some of their plunder. After they
went out I bolted the door. They came again
and broke it open with their tomahawks. I
immediately applied to a British officer, and
told him the Indians were interrupting the
wounded. He turned round, and called to
another officer to send the guard. The Indians
at that time had plundered the commissary’s
house (which was near the house
in which the wounded were) of everything
they wanted, and piled rails against it and
set them on fire: I, with the assistance of two
British officers, put it out. One of the British
officers (Maj. Rundels) inquired where the
ammunition was. I told him, if there was
any, it was above stairs. We went up, but
could find none. There was a large quantity
of wheat on the loft; he said it was a
pity it was there, for the Indians would burn
the house. I apprehended by that, the town
was to be burned, and began to lament our
wretched condition. After we went down
stairs, Rundels asked me how many we had
killed and wounded on the 18th. I told him,
but he very haughtily disputed it. I had the
return in my pocket. He read it, but made
no reply.</p>

<p>Those that remained of us being hungry,
I applied to one of the British in the evening
for some flour, as there were a good many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
barrels in the commissary’s house, which I
considered to belong to them. He told me to
take as much as I wanted. I asked him if
there was a guard left? He said there was no
necessity for any, for the Indians were going
to their camp, and there were interpreters
left who would walk from house to house and
see that we should not be interrupted. He
kept walking about and looking towards the
road. He told me I had better keep in the
house, for the Indians would as soon shoot
me as not, although he had just told me we
should not be interrupted! I suspected he
was looking for Gen. Harrison. Oh! if we
had seen General Harrison coming with his
troops, the wounded would have leaped for
joy! but I did not expect him.</p>

<p>As they did not leave the <i>promised guard</i>,
I lost all confidence in them, and expected
we would be all massacred before morning.
I being the only person in this house not
wounded, with the assistance of some of the
wounded, I prepared something for about
thirty to eat. The Indians kept searching
about town till after dark. One came in the
house who could talk English, and said he
commanded a company after the retreating
party, and that most of that party were slain.
He said the men gave up their guns, plead for
quarters, and offered them money if they
would not kill them; but his boys, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
called them, would tomahawk them without
distinction. He said the plan that was fixed
on by the Indians and British, before the
battle commenced, was that the British were
to attack in front to induce us to charge on
them; 500 Indians were placed on the right
hand and 500 on the left, to flank round and
take possession of the town; but he said we
were too cunning for them; we would not
move out of the pickets.</p>

<p>We passed this night under the most serious
apprehensions of being massacred by
the tomahawk or consumed in the flames. I
frequently went out during the night to see
if the house was set on fire. At length the
long wished-for morn arrived, and filled each
heart with a cheerful hope of being delivered
from the cruelty of those merciless savages.
We were making every preparation to be
ready for the promised sleighs; but, alas!
instead of the sleighs, about an hour by sun
a great number of savages, painted with various
colors, came yelling in the most hideous
manner! These bloodthirsty, terrific savages
(sent here by their more cruel and perfidious
allies, the British) rushed into the houses
where the desponding wounded lay, and insolently
stripped them of their blankets and
all their best clothes, and ordered them out
of the houses! I ran out of the house to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
inform the interpreters<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> what the Indians
were doing. At the door, an Indian took my
hat and put it on his own head. I then discovered
the Indians had been at the other
house first, and had used the wounded in like
manner. As I turned to go back into the
house, an Indian, taking hold of me, made
signs for me to stand by the corner of the
house. I made signs to him I wanted to go
in and get my hat; for I desired to see what
they had done with the wounded. The Indians
sent in a boy who brought out a hat
and threw it down to me, and I could not
get in the house. Three Indians came up to
me and pulled off my coat. My feeble powers
cannot describe the dismal scenes here
exhibited. I saw my fellow-soldiers, naked
and wounded, crawling out of the houses to
avoid being consumed in the flames. Some
that had not been able to turn themselves on
their beds for four days, through fear of being
burned to death, arose and walked out
and about through the yard. Some cried
for help, but there were none to help them.
“Ah!” exclaimed numbers, in the anguish
of their spirit, “what shall we do?” A number,
unable to get out, miserably perished in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the unrelenting flames of the houses, kindled
by the more unrelenting savages. Now the
scenes of cruelty and murder we had been
anticipating with dread, during last night,
fully commenced. The savages rushed on
the wounded, and, in their barbarous manner,
shot, and tomahawked, and scalped them; and
cruelly mangled their naked bodies while
they lay agonizing and weltering in their
blood. A number were taken towards Malden,
but being unable to march with speed,
were inhumanly massacred. The road was,
for miles, strewed with the mangled bodies,
and all of them were left like those slain in
battle, on the 22d, for birds and beasts to tear
in pieces and devour. The Indians plundered
the town of everything valuable, and set the
best houses on fire. The Indian who claimed
me, gave me a coat, and when he had got as
much plunder as he could carry, he ordered
me, by signs, to march, which I did, with extreme
reluctance, in company with three of
the wounded and six or seven Indians. In
travelling about a quarter of a mile, two of
the wounded lagged behind about twenty
yards. The Indians, turning round, shot one
and scalped him. They shot at the other and
missed him; he, running up to them, begged
that they would not shoot him. He said he
would keep up, and give them money. But
these murderers were not moved with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
doleful cries. They shot him down; and,
rushing on him in a crowd, scalped him. In
like manner my brother Allen perished. He
marched with difficulty after the wounded,
about two or three hundred yards, and was
there barbarously murdered. My feelings
at the sight and recollection of these inhuman
butcheries cannot be described. In addition
to these deep sorrows for the mournful fate
of my companions, and the cruel death of a
dear brother, I expected every moment, for
a considerable time, that the same kind of
cruelty and death would be my portion. The
Indians that guarded me and one of the
wounded, observing our consternation, one
that could talk English said, “We will not
shoot you.” This a little revived our hopes,
that were almost gone;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> and he, having cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
a piece, hide and all, of a dead cow, started.
It is their common practice to kill a cow or
hog, and take a piece, and leave the rest. In
travelling two miles, we came to a house
where there were two British officers; the
Indian made a halt, and I asked one of the
officers what the Indian was going to do with
me; he said he was going to take me to Amherstburg
(or Malden). I judged these villains
had instructed the Indians to do what
they had done. A few miles farther, we came
to the Indian encampment, where there were a
great many hallooing and yelling in a hideous
manner. I thought this my place of destiny.
The Indian took off my pack, broiled a piece
of meat and gave me part; this I ate merely
in obedience to him. Then we started and
arrived at Amherstburg, eighteen miles from
Frenchtown. The other prisoners had just
arrived. The British were firing their salute.
The Indian took me into a house not far from
the fort; it was probably their council house;
it would have held 500. It was inhabited by
a large number of squaws, children, and dogs.
They welcomed me by giving me some bread,
meat and hominy to eat. After this an Indian
asked me if I had a squaw; I told him
not; he immediately turned round and talked
to the squaws in Indian, while I sat in a pensive
mood observing their motions. I discovered
the squaws were pleased, by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
tittering and grinning; one, I observed, had
a great desire to express her joy by showing
her teeth; but the length of time she had
lived in this world had put it out of her power.
I suspected, from their manœuvres, I
would have to undergo a disagreeable adoption
(as other prisoners had done)—and,
what was a task still more unpleasant, to be
united in the conjugal band to one of these
swarthy, disgustful animals. The Indian
asked me a few questions—where we had
come from—how far it was—when we started—and
if there were any more coming. In
reply to these questions, I gave him but little
satisfaction. After this they spread blankets
down, and made signs for me to go to bed. I
did, and soon fell asleep, as I was much fatigued
and had not slept much for four nights
past. Early next morning, the Indian collected
his family and all his property, and
started: I knew not where he was going; he
gave me a knapsack and gun to carry. Now
I despaired of getting with the other prisoners,
unless I could desert from the Indians!
I expected I would be taken to an Indian
town, there to undergo a disagreeable adoption,
or to be burned to death with firebrands.
As he took me near Fort Malden, I took as
good a view of it as I could while I passed it.
It stands about thirty yards from the river
bank. I judged it to be seventy or eighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
yards square; the wall appeared to be built
of timber and clay. The side, from the river,
was not walled, but had double pickets, and
entrenched round, about four feet deep; and
in the entrenchment was the second row of
pickets. As we went on through the edge
of town (Amherstburg) I asked an Englishman
where the other prisoners were? He
said they were in town, in a wood-yard; the
Indian hurried me along and would not let
me talk to the Englishman. The Indian had
a little horse, packed with his plunder, which
I resolved to take, if possible, and ride into
town that night.</p>

<p>He took me to his place of residence, about
three miles from Malden. I was anxious for
the approach of night, so that I might make
my escape. While I was consoling myself
with the anticipation of seeing my fellow
sufferers at Malden, night made its approach.
Some time after dark the Indian spread blankets
down, and made signs for me to lie down,
and put my coat, shoes, and socks, under his
own head. I wanted him to leave my socks
on, for my feet would get cold; he made signs
to warm them by the fire. Thus I was sadly
disappointed.</p>

<p>Next day he examined all his plunder. He
had a very good suit of clothes, besides several
other coats, socks, shoes, &amp;c.; among
these were Wesley’s Sermons and a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
many papers, which he gave me to read. I
found several old letters, but nothing of value.
He discovered I wanted to shave, and got his
razor, shaving-box, and a piece of glass, and
made signs for me to shave. After this, I
lay down on some blankets and fell asleep.
He came and awoke me, and gave me a twist
of tobacco, which I received as a token of
friendship. In a short time after, he started
to Malden, and made signs for me to stay
there till he would come back. He returned
in the evening with a blanket, tied full of
loaves of bread, just out of the oven, besides
some meat. The Indians always gave me a
plenty to eat; and served me before any of
the family, with more politeness than I expected
to find amongst them. He had drawn
some money. I asked him to let me look at
it. I found it to be pieces of cards with the
number of livres written on them.</p>

<p>The third night at length arrived; and he
made my bed as usual; and took my coat
and shoes, but accidentally left my socks on.
I lay down with the determination to leave
him before morning. I slept very well for
awhile. When I awoke, the house was dark.
I thought this as good an opportunity of deserting
as I could get, but with considerable
timidity I made the attempt. I crawled to
the door very easily, and raised the blanket
that hung up at the door; just as I was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
out he coughed, and I stopped until I thought
he was asleep, and then started, without shoes
or coat, to Amherstburg. When I got there,
I examined several yards and gardens to see
if there was any fire. After going through
many streets, I turned my course towards
the river, and accidentally came to the house
where the prisoners were. The sentinel, who
was standing at the door, let me in without
much ceremony. Providence smiled on this
attempt to extricate myself from the Indians.
Thus, through mercy, I escaped from the
savages, and was delivered from the doleful
apprehensions of being sacrificed in some
barbarous and cruel manner, to gratify their
bloodthirsty souls. I got in between two of
my comrades who were lying next to the
door. My feet were almost frozen before
morning.</p>

<p>During my captivity with the Indians, the
other prisoners were treated very inhumanly.
The first night, they were put in a wood-yard;
the rain commenced early in the night, and
put out all their fires. In this manner they
passed a tedious night, wet, and benumbed
with cold. From this place they were taken
to a cold warehouse, still deprived of fire,
with their clothes and blankets frozen, and
nothing to eat but a little bread. In this
wretched condition they continued two days
and three nights!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span><i>26th.</i> The Indians came early in the morning
to search for me, but they were not admitted
into the house. The guard said it
would be well for me to keep as much concealed
as possible, for if the Indian I had left
could get me he would kill me. He came to
the door, and made motions to show how he
would scalp me. I disguised myself by changing
my clothes and tying up my head, so that
he did not know me.</p>

<p>The prisoners being destined to Fort George,
were divided in two divisions, the first to keep
a day’s march before the second, in order,
probably, to be better supplied with provisions
on the way.</p>

<p>I being attached to the first division, the
Indians examined the lines very closely for
me, but not possessing discernment sufficient
to know me, I fortunately escaped.</p>

<p>Malden, or Amherstburg, is situated on the
east side of Detroit River, near its junction
with Lake Erie, and contains about one hundred
houses, mostly frame; in lat. 42° 22′
N., long. 8° 3′ W. from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>We set out from this town, and marched
seventeen miles to Sandwich, a small town
on the east side of Detroit River, and one
mile below Detroit; it contains perhaps about
three hundred inhabitants. We were divided
in small companies, and put into different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
houses, where we had the happiness once more
to see fire.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i> We drew a ration of bread and fresh
beef, but no salt, and had no way of cooking
the beef. We commenced our march at 1
o’clock, and marched ten miles, part of the
way on Lake St. Clair. In the evening we
were conducted to cold barns, and there shut
up till morning, deprived of fire.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i> We recommenced our march early,
as cold a morning as ever I experienced, and
continued twenty-four miles on Lake St.
Clair; at night we were conducted to a cold
barn on the beach; we lay without fire, except
a few who could not get in, who had the
happiness of encamping in the woods.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i> We again resumed our march, and
continued on the lake fifteen miles to the
mouth of La Tranche River, called by some
the River Thames; during this time we had
to run to keep ourselves from freezing; we
continued up the river five miles, and stopped
while the guard went in to warm and to get
their dinner. Having drawn no provisions
since we left Sandwich, some of the prisoners
were driven to the necessity of picking up
frozen potatoes and apple peelings that had
been thrown out in the yard. One of the
prisoners, being unable to keep pace with the
rest, was left on the lake, but was accidentally
overtaken by a sleigh and brought on. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
being in a stove room some time, he was led
out to march, trembling with cold. One of the
guard observed, “he was a man of no spirit
to freeze such a day as this.” So barbarous
were their dispositions and treatment, that I
concluded we should die of cold and hunger.
We marched ten miles farther to Captain Dolson’s,
where we were conducted into a large
still-house. A number lodged below among
the still-tubs by the fire; the rest on the loft,
where they were annoyed with the smoke.
Some time in the night they brought us a
little bread and meat.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i> We drew two days’ provisions, and
cooked it.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i> It snowed all day; notwithstanding,
we marched twenty-four miles and were shut
up in a barn wet and cold. Going to a barn
to lodge so cold an evening was like approaching
a formidable enemy, for we expected
to perish with cold in the dreary dwelling.
Many got their feet frostbitten. We tried
in vain to keep our shoes from freezing by
putting them under our heads.</p>

<p><i>February 1.</i> We continued our march twenty-two
miles in a thinly settled country, and
passed through the Moravian nation of Indians;
in the evening we encamped in the
woods.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i> We marched twenty-two miles, suffering
greatly both with hunger and cold. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
the evening we arrived at Delaware township,
a small settlement on the River La Tranche.
We were divided into small companies, and
were permitted to lodge in houses by fires.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i> We had been two days without provisions.
Here we drew rations for three days.
Capt. Dolson left us to-day; the prisoners
must forever detest his baseness and cruelty.
We resumed our march in the evening and
continued five miles, notwithstanding the
snow was two feet deep, and it was then snowing.
We were better treated by our new guard.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i> We marched twenty-six miles to the
head waters of the River Thames, to Oxford
township, a settlement of ten or twelve miles
in length.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i> We marched two miles, and were detained
for a supply of provisions.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> After being
supplied we continued our march in the
evening three miles farther, and where we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
lodged were treated very civilly by the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span><i>6th.</i> After marching twenty-four miles,
principally through a wilderness, we arrived
at Burford township.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span><i>7th.</i> In marching thirty miles to a little
village near the head of Lake Ontario, we
passed through the Mohawk Nation of Indians
on Grand River, who are much whiter
than any we have seen; their mode of dress
is not different from other Indian nations,
and they have the same savage appearance;
we were informed that there are six nations
on this river who hold a large body of the
best land.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i> We drew our rations and proceeded
on sixteen miles. In going down towards
Lake Ontario, we descended a precipice upwards
of two hundred feet into a level country;
this precipice extends across Niagara
River, and occasions those remarkable falls.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i> We marched eighteen miles through
a well-settled country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span><i>10th.</i> We marched sixteen miles to Newark,
lately called Niagara West; it contains
about five hundred inhabitants; many of the
buildings are handsome, composed of brick
and stone; it has several churches, an academy,
six taverns, and about twenty stores;
it is situated on the west side of Niagara
River, in lat. 43° 15′ N., long. 4° west; Fort
George stands at the upper end of the
town.</p>

<p>We continued here no longer than was
necessary to make arrangements to cross the
river. A British officer took down our names,
and the regiment and company we belonged
to, and said “we must not take up arms
against Great Britain and her allies until
legally exchanged.” Thus we were parolled;
they hoisted a flag and took us across Niagara
River,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> which is about one-quarter of a mile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
wide to Fort Niagara, which is situated at
the junction of Niagara River and Lake Ontario,
in New York State; it is strongly fortified,
and well supplied with artillery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A FEW REMARKS RESPECTING UPPER CANADA<br>
AND ITS INHABITANTS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Malden to Sandwich, and a considerable
distance up St. Clair, resembles a level
plain thickly interspersed with farms and
houses; many places look like little villages.
The houses are principally frame, and have
an ancient appearance. Besides being well
supplied with grain from their farms, they receive
considerable benefit from their orchards.</p>

<p>The River La Tranche is a considerable
navigable stream, and runs a westerly course
into Lake St. Clair; the land near it is rich
and fertile; the timber is oak, ash, hickory,
walnut, sugar-tree, &amp;c. It is thickly settled
as far as Moraviantown; but, from the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
on the north side, is an extensive wilderness
of poor swampy land. From Moraviantown
to Grand River is a wilderness of poor piney
land, except Delaware, Oxford, and Burford
townships, which are tolerable settlements.
From Grand River to Fort George, is a rich,
well-settled country, particularly along Lake
Ontario. The inhabitants are composed of
English, French, Dutch, and a great many
emigrants from the United States. The
whole has been estimated at eighty thousand;
besides these, there are unknown numbers of
Indians. The Canadians are generally a well-looking
people, remarkably fair, but not well
informed. They do not set a great value on
education, and it is not encouraged by the
government. Although their laws appear to
be moderate, yet neither the freedom of speech
nor the freedom of the press is encouraged.
The officers are haughty and tyrannical in
the execution of their orders. I learned that
a majority<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> of the inhabitants were in favor
of the United States government, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
had concealed themselves to avoid taking up
arms.</p>

<p>The British forces consist of regulars,
flankers, militia, <i>Negroes</i>, and Indians. Agreeably
to an act of their assembly in 1812, their
flankers are riflemen, volunteered or drafted
for the term of six months, and longer if not
then relieved. The militia cannot be called
into service for more than twenty days, unless
their country is invaded. I heard of two
companies of <i>Negroes</i>, runaways from Kentucky,
and other States, who are commanded
by white men. A great many of the Indians
are stationed near the lines, who can be called
to arms at a minute’s warning.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i> After regaling ourselves on the plenty
of food and drink afforded us in the land of
liberty, we set our faces homewards. One
mile from Niagara Fort, we came to Salt Battery;
it was composed of barrels of salt and
dirt. From this they could play upon Fort
George. We proceeded up the river eight
miles to Lewistown, which is on the east bank
of Niagara River, opposite Queenstown, and
contains only a few houses; eight miles farther,
we came to Grand Niagara, a small village
on the east bank of Niagara River just
above the falls, and nearly opposite Chippeway.
Above the falls, in the middle of the
river, is an island about three hundred yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
long, the lower end of which is just at the
perpendicular edge of the fall. On both
sides of this island, all the waters of the
rivers and lakes to the north-west, fall down
a precipice of one hundred and thirty-seven
feet perpendicular, and fall near as much more
in a rapid of nine miles below. Before the
water comes to the fall, as it passes the island,
it seems in swiftness to outfly an arrow.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i> We arrived at Black Rock, nineteen
miles above the falls. Here is a considerable
village, a navy yard, and three batteries well
furnished with cannon. It took its name
from its rocky situation. From this we continued
on two miles and a half to Buffalo,
the capital of Buffalo county, New York
State. It is situated at the foot of Lake Erie,
opposite to Fort Erie.</p>

<p>We continued at Buffalo one day, on account
of the badness of the weather, and then
continued our march thirty-two miles on the
lake, and then marched through a well-settled
country to Erie, the county town of Erie
county, in Pennsylvania. It is ninety miles
from Buffalo, and is situated on the south-east
shore of Lake Erie. We proceeded on
by the way of Waterford and Meadville, one
hundred and twenty miles, to Pittsburgh, and
from Pittsburgh to Kentucky, by water.</p>

<p>Language fails to express the emotions I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
felt on arriving safely at home, to enjoy the
caresses and society of dear friends, after
having endured so much fatigue, and having
been so often exposed to imminent danger;
and having so frequently expected death, attended
with <i>all the horrors of Indian cruelty</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NARRATIVE<br>
<span class="medium">OF</span><br>
MR. TIMOTHY MALLARY.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the battle on the 22d January,
1813, at Frenchtown, on the River Raisin,
between the combined forces of British,
Canadians, and Indians, and the American
forces, I received a wound from a piece of
plank, which had been split off by a cannon
ball. It struck me on the side, and unfortunately
broke three of my ribs. The battle
having terminated in favor of the combined
forces, and I not being able to travel with
those American prisoners who were to march
immediately for Malden, I remained on the
ground until the next morning, with the rest
of my wounded countrymen, who had received
a solemn promise from the British
commander, that they should be taken to
Malden in sleighs.</p>

<p>This sacred promise was not regarded! It
was sacrificed on the altar of savage barbarity!
to the god of murder and cruelty!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Instead of sleighs, Indians were sent prepared
to murder these unfortunate victims! who,
after they had executed in part their purpose
on the ground where we lay, ordered several
other prisoners and myself to march for Malden.
We had not proceeded far before they
tomahawked four of this number, amongst
whom was Captain Hart, of Lexington. He
had hired an Indian to take him to Malden.
I saw part of this hire paid to the Indian.</p>

<p>After having taken him some distance, another
Indian demanded him, saying that he
was his prisoner; the hireling would not give
him up; the claimant, finding that he could
not get him alive, shot him in the left side
with a pistol. Capt. Hart still remained on
his horse; the claimant then ran up, struck
him with a tomahawk, pulled him off his
horse, scalped him, and left him lying there.</p>

<p>We proceeded on until we came within
three miles of Brownstown, where we encamped
for the night. The next day we
proceeded on to their encampment, seven or
eight miles from Detroit, on the River Rouge,
which appeared to be head-quarters. They
were furnished at this place with bark wig-wams;
here was a large number of squaws
and children, I suppose two thousand.</p>

<p>They here stripped off my clothes, and
dressed me after the Indian manner. They
shaved off my hair, except a small quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
on the top of my head, which they left for
the purpose of rendering the task of scalping
more easy. They bored my ears, which they
supplied plentifully with ear-rings, frequently
by hanging one in another, like the links of
a chain. They wanted to bore my nose, but
I objected, and they did not insist. They
frequently painted my face one-half black
and the other red, and frequently with red
and black streaks.</p>

<p>Shortly after our arrival at these encampments,
I was adopted into a Pottowatomie
family that had lost a son in the battle at the
River Raisin.</p>

<p>I was presented to this family by an Indian
whose name was <i>Ke-wi-ex-kim</i>. He introduced
me to my father and mother, brothers
and sisters, and instructed me to call them
by these respective appellations. My father’s
name was <i>Asa Chipsaw</i>, after whom they call
me; they asked me if I had a squaw; I answered
in the negative, at which they appeared
well pleased, and brought me a squaw,
urging me to marry her. I refused, and told
them when I got well I would accede to the
proposals; this they took as a great offence.
After having made themselves acquainted
with the situation of my wound, they made
a tea of sassafras and cherry-tree barks, which
was the only drink I was permitted to take
for fifteen days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>They frequently took me to Detroit, for
the purpose of helping them to pack provisions
from thence to their encampment. But
they would not suffer me to talk to the inhabitants
of that place. Fifteen loaves of
bread, weighing three pounds each, ten
pounds of pork or beef, and a peck of corn,
was what they drew for six days. This would
not last more than half that time; the remaining
part they lived upon fragments of dog
or horse meat. They appeared indifferent
whether they had killed the animal that day
themselves, or whether it had died by some
accidental cause seven or eight days prior to
their eating it.</p>

<p>They appointed me cook. I then had to
undergo much fatigue in getting wood, &amp;c.,
for they lent no assistance. Their customary
way of cooking is to boil the meat and make
soup, which they immediately devour without
salt.</p>

<p>They have drunken frolics, whenever they
can get any kind of spirits to drink. When
these frolics take place the squaws hid me,
to prevent them from murdering me. Once
I was hid in some brush and deprived of food
for four days, during which time there was
a continual uproar in the camp, as though they
had been killing each other.</p>

<p>The squaws, who frequently visited me,
and to whom I as often applied for something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
to eat, informed me that there could be nothing
had until the men got sober, who would
then either kill provisions, or draw from
Detroit. On the fourth day, when I had
given up to perish, they brought me a piece
of a dog cooked without salt, and although
you may feel squeamish when I mention it,
yet it was to me the sweetest morsel that I
ever recollect to have eaten.</p>

<p>During my stay with them I saw them
take a number of scalps to Malden, for which
they said they received from four to six dollars
each, either in whiskey or store goods.
They said they got thirty-seven scalps at the
battle of the 18th, and upwards of four hundred
at that of the 22d January. I replied,
that there were only ten scalped on the 18th.
They said “Yankee d—d lie;” and they further
stated, that they had only two killed on
the 18th. I replied, Indian d—d lie, for I
saw myself twelve dead on the field. I asked
them how many British and Indians were at
the River Raisin, on the 22d January; they
replied, that there were two thousand five
hundred Indians, and one thousand British.</p>

<p>They would frequently make motions imitating
the Americans when they were scalping
them, by turning, twisting, mourning,
&amp;c.; this was done to aggravate me.</p>

<p>They once gave me a jug of whiskey, requesting
me to drink. I drank what satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
me, and offered them the jug again—they
insisted on me to drink more; I put the
jug to my head, but did not drink; they discovered
the cheat, and cried out “Yankee no
good man, d—d lie;” they then made me
drink until they could hear it gurgle in my
throat.</p>

<p>About three weeks before the battle at the
Rapids, the squaws and boys were employed
in dressing deer-skins, which were to equip
the warriors for their march thither. During
this time, the warriors were collecting and
dancing the war-dance. They informed me
that they were going to Quo-by-ghaw, which
I learned from the French, was the Rapids.
I further learned that the British had promised
them the possession of Fort Meigs, as
well as the disposal of Gen. Harrison. They
then calculated on Fort Meigs as their chief
place of deposit, from which they could make
incursions into the State of Ohio, kill a vast
number of the inhabitants, and satisfy themselves
with plunder. They calculated on
having a three days’ frolic in the burning of
Gen. Harrison.</p>

<p>Two weeks before their march for Fort
Meigs, Tecumseh was with them. He was
busily employed rallying those who were indifferent
about going to the battle, and encouraging
those who had volunteered; amongst
other persuasive arguments to volunteer, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
made use of these, viz.: that Fort Meigs was
badly constructed and illy defended; asserting
that they could take it without the loss
of a man. But, if this could not be effected,
he would then lead them on to Fort Wayne,
which would certainly fall an easy prey to
them. He then left them, and went to the
Wabash to brings his warriors, who were
stationed at that place.</p>

<p>Previous to the march of the Indians, they
took bark of swamp willow, and tobacco,
mixed them together, and pulverized them.
They then formed a circle round a fire which
had been prepared for that purpose, and one
rose and delivered a speech, I understood,
relative to the war. At the conclusion of the
speech, they passed this powder around the
circle, each individual taking a pinch as it
passed; each then snuffed a part of this portion,
and threw the remaining part in the
fire. After this had been performed with
the greatest solemnity, one took the snuff
which yet remained in the vessel, and threw
it in the fire. They then took up their packs,
raised the scalp halloo, waved their tomahawks
over their heads, and marched for battle.</p>

<p>There were three thousand who drew four
days’ rations at Detroit. When they left us,
they told us to be good boys, and stay there
till they came back, and they would bring
some more Yankees, who should cook, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
do all the hard work, and we might go with
them hunting.</p>

<p>They left us in care of the squaws and a
few old men.</p>

<p>We had no other way by which to get free
from this unpleasant situation, but deserting
them; for they had been offered one hundred
dollars each, for four of us, by the citizens of
Detroit, but refused it. These four were
Major Graves, Samuel Ganoe, John Davenport,
and myself.</p>

<p>Thinking this as favorable an opportunity
as we could get, I requested Samuel Ganoe
to set off with me; he readily consented, and
we set off just at dark, and ran to Detroit,
which was eight miles, and got to the house
of Mr. H., who concealed us in his cellar.
He had a hole dug in the bottom of his cellar
six or eight feet deep, for the purpose of keeping
potatoes; and in this we were put, and
he laid planks over it, and threw dirt on the
planks, which caused it to bear so nice a semblance
to the other part of the cellar, that the
Indians could not distinguish it from the
common bottom. This dismal dungeon was
our abode for half a day, during which time
the Indians came, and searched carefully for
us, but in vain. After they were gone, Mr.
H. asked a British officer if he would take
the care of us. He replied in the affirmative,
and then sent us immediately to the fort at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Detroit, where we were kept two days, the
Indians still searching for us. On the second
night about midnight, we were sent to Sandwich,
and kept there two days with but little
to eat, and then sent to Malden. We found
the force at Malden to consist of sixty Canadian
French, besides eighty who had received
wounds at the River Raisin, and who would
no doubt remain invalids for life. We also
found stationed at Malden, James Girty, who,
I was informed, was brother to the infamous
Simon Girty; his business was to receive
scalps from the Indians; his pay for this service
was three dollars per week. I saw here
about half a bushel of scalps in a kettle! the
number I cannot guess at.</p>

<p>After every exertion to take Fort Meigs
had failed, the British returned to Malden,
cursing Harrison for a rabbit, which they
swore had burrowed, and which they could
not take in that situation.</p>

<p>From Malden we were taken across to
Cleveland, on the 16th day of May, 1813.</p>

<p>The following prisoners were with the Indians
at the time I was a prisoner, viz.: Major
Graves, Jarret Dougherty, Thomas Jones,
Joseph Foddre, and John Fightmaster; the
latter of whom had deserted from us, was
brought back, and made to ride the wooden
horse. He then deserted to the Indians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
swearing—he had rather stay with them than
ride Winchester’s <i>English mare</i> again.</p>

<p>I heard of three other prisoners, but do not
remember their names; two of whom were
about twenty miles from Detroit, and the
other near Malden.</p>

<p>From Cleveland nothing worth relating
occurred until I arrived at home, in Bourbon
county, Kentucky; where I found my friends
all in good health, my father excepted, who
had gone to face the same enemy from whom
I had just made my escape.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NARRATIVE<br>

<span class="medium">OF</span><br>

MR. JOHN DAVENPORT.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the battle which was fought on the
18th of January, 1813, between the American
forces, under the command of Colonel Lewis,
and the combined British and Indians, I received
a wound in my right leg by a ball
which fractured the bone, but did not entirely
break it. After the battle was over I,
with many others who were also wounded,
was carried off the field and put in a house,
where we remained until after the battle of
the 22d, when we were surrendered prisoners
of war to the British. I remained here during
the night of the 22d, with the expectation of
being carried to Malden the next day, but in
this I was disappointed. On the morning of
the 23d I witnessed the most horrid scenes
of cruelty imaginable; for the British, instead
of sending sleighs, as was most solemnly promised,
to convey the wounded prisoners to
Maiden, sent the Indians, who, after selecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
a few from amongst the wounded, tomahawked
and scalped the rest in the most
savage and cruel manner that malice could
invent, or devils incarnate execute, and set
fire to the houses in which they had been
and burned them to ashes! Then, instead of
going to Malden, they took me to Brownstown,
where I had nothing to eat except a
little parched corn. While I was at Brownstown
an Indian asked me whether I had a
squaw, to which I answered in the negative.
He then replied, “<i>We make an Indian of you,
and by’n by you have a squaw, by’n by you
have a gun and horse and go a hunting.</i>” The
next day we proceeded on our march until
we came near the River Rouge, where the
Indians procured some provisions, consisting
of fresh meat, but no salt. From here we
set off again and travelled slowly (I rather
think to favor the wounded) until we arrived
at their encampment, three or four miles
from Detroit, at which place there were a
number of squaws and children who had
taken up winter quarters.</p>

<p>As soon as we had arrived at this place I
was presented to an old squaw, whom the
Indians instructed me to call by the appellation
of mother. This old witch, as I took
her to be, had lost two sons at the River
Raisin; I had therefore to supply the place
of one of them, and thus had to become the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
adopted son of the most hideous of all animals
that ever roamed over the forests of
North America. After this they dressed my
wound for the first time, which now appeared
to be getting well fast; in the next place they
trimmed my hair off, except a small quantity
on the top of my head, and painted me; then
adorned me with ear-rings, bracelets, &amp;c. and
put a band of silver round my head. By
this time I began to look very stylish, or
rather made as uncouth and grotesque a
figure as any of my <i>copper-colored brethren</i>.</p>

<p>While we remained at this place Mr. Gabriel
Godfrey, a citizen of Detroit, offered the
Indians $100 for my ransom, which they refused.
I now began to conclude that there
were no other means of extricating myself
from bondage, unless it were by flight, and
therefore determined to embrace the first
opportunity that presented. In a few days
after, the Indians presented a squaw to me,
who appeared to have little more of humanity
than the form, but equally as detestable as
my <i>mother</i>, although she was younger. This
ugly looking creature the Indians told me I
should marry! I confess I never was so
shocked at the thoughts of matrimony in my
life! I told them “<i>no good squaw</i>.” They
then brought several more of those inhuman
looking creatures, whom I understood were
also candidates for conjugal felicity. I told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
them “<i>by’n by I have a squaw</i>.” This appeared
to satisfy them at the present time;
in this manner I frequently had to put them
off.</p>

<p>They frequently solicited me to wear a
breech-clout, which I always refused. One
time my mother discovered me mending my
pantaloons; thinking this a good opportunity
to get me to wear one, she immediately
brought one, which I took hold of and said
“no good,” then threw it down and stamped
it. At the sight of this she was very much
enraged, and scolded desperately to herself
in her own Indian dialect. I have often wondered
since that they did not kill me for disobeying
their orders, for I was extremely
obstinate, and scarcely ever complied with
their injunctions.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my disobedience, the Indians
treated me as well as was in their
power, especially my mother, who was very
kind to me. Some considerable time I had
to eat my victuals without salt. I knew they
had none, yet I would always ask for some.
My old mother, after some time, procured
some for me, which she kept hid to prevent
the others from making use of it, and never
failed to give me a small portion when I was
eating.</p>

<p>Intoxication is practised by the squaws as
well as the men; they frequently have drunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
frolics, at which times it is dangerous for
prisoners to be amongst them. During these
frantic revels the prisoners are kept hid by
the squaws (a part of whom keep sober) to
keep them from being murdered. One night,
after the rest had gone to bed, my mother,
who had stayed out later than usual, came in,
sat down, and began to sing; she did not
appear to be in her senses; I soon discovered
that this old priestess of Bacchus had got
very drunk. In this mood she seized hold
of the fire and threw it on those who were
sleeping round the fire, which soon caused
them to rise; she then jumped into the fire
and danced until she had burned the soles of
her moccasons off.</p>

<p>They continued here about a month, and
then removed about eight miles on the River
Rouge, in order to prepare for making sugar.
While we were employed at this business a
Frenchman persuaded me to marry a squaw,
if they insisted, for I would then be treated
with more respect, and consequently would
have greater liberties. After mature consideration,
I thought probably this would be
the best plan I could adopt, in order to make
my escape, and therefore resolved to marry
the next one that was presented to me. It
was not long before they brought me a squaw
(the most decent looking one I had seen),
whom I resolved to marry without hesitation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
I however, when just on the point of
forming a connubial alliance with her, was
prevented by an Indian, who claimed her as
<i>his</i> squaw.</p>

<p>Several weeks before the battle of Fort
Meigs, the Indians began to collect and dance
the <i>war-dance</i>.</p>

<p>Just before the Indians marched they prepared
a number of hoops, both ends of which
they stuck in the ground and spread their
blankets over them. In this place they put
hot stones, threw water on them, and then
went in themselves and remained until they
were wet with sweat. This I conjectured
was done in the way of devotion, or in imploring
the assistance of the Great Spirit in
their intended expedition.</p>

<p>When the Indians marched I was committed
to the care of the squaws and a few
old invalids. Thinking this the most favorable
opportunity I could get, I was determined
to put my plan in execution. At night
I lay down with the intention of starting
when the moon arose, but overslept my time
and did not awake till daylight. I arose and
started, notwithstanding I was apprehensive
of being discovered, and ran directly to Detroit,
a distance of about nine miles, probably
in as short a time as any Indian in the nation
could have performed the same journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>As soon as I had arrived at Detroit I went
to Mr. T. S’s, who had persuaded me to run
away, and he and his friends would conceal
me, which they did accordingly. It was but
a short time before a Frenchman, of the name
of Shover, and some squaws, came in search
of me, but could not find me.</p>

<p>From here I was sent to Sandwich, and
concealed there two days, and suffered extremely
for provisions. From Sandwich I
was sent to Malden, where I found six of my
fellow-prisoners, who, together with myself,
were kept under close confinement in the
fort for three weeks. While we remained
here we frequently heard from the Rapids,
but the news was always favorable on the
British side. One morning an old man, who
looked as if he had just emerged from the
lower regions, came into the fort and exclaimed,
“good news, gentlemen! good news!
we have killed <i>fifteen hundred Yankees</i>, and
have taken Harrison and all the rest that
were at the fort prisoners!!” I was informed
afterwards that this old man was the notorious
Simon Girty, so much renowned for
cruelty and slaughter, and who has delighted
in the shrieks of dying women and <i>expiring
infants</i>!</p>

<p>From the most correct information I could
obtain, their forces at the siege of Fort Meigs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
consisting of British regulars, Canadian militia,
and Indians, amounted to 5,000!</p>

<p>From Malden I was taken across to Cleveland,
and from there I pursued my journey
towards the delightful regions of Kentucky,
where I arrived in Montgomery county, in
June, 1813.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> To prove that this surrender was not in consequence
of the want of ammunition and provisions, it is sufficient
to state, upon the authority of official information, that
there were thirty-three pieces of cannon, twenty-five of
which were brass and eight iron, which were well manned
and supplied with ammunition.</p>

<p>For the muskets, seventy-five thousand cartridges were
made up, besides twenty-four rounds in the cartouch-box
of each man.</p>

<p>In the magazine were sixty barrels of powder, and one
hundred and fifty tons of lead.</p>

<p>In the contractor’s store were at least twenty-five days’
provision; and in the adjacent country considerable supplies
could have been had, besides three hundred head of
cattle, under an escort commanded by Captain Brush, at
the River Raisin.</p>

son, and was probably a Captain.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[F]</a> The French, who were looking at us when we started,
were heard to say, we were not men enough.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[G]</a> A Frenchman who lived in this village said when the
word came the Americans were in sight, there was an old
Indian smoking at his fireside; the Indian exclaimed,
“<i>Ho, de Mericans come; I suppose Ohio men come, we give
them another chase</i>:” (alluding to the time they chased Gen.
Tapper from the Rapids.) He walked to the door smoking,
apparently very unconcerned, and looked at us till
we formed the line of battle, and rushed on them with a
mighty shout! he then called out “<i>Kentuck, by God!</i>”
and picked up his gun and ran to the woods like a wild
beast.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[H]</a> It would have been better for us if we had been contented
with the possession of the village, without pursuing
them to the woods.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[I]</a> This want of precaution was a great cause of our
mournful defeat!</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[J]</a> When the right wing began to retreat, it is said orders
were given by some of the officers to the men in the
eastern end of the picketing to march out to their assistance.
Capt. Price and a number of men sallied out.
Capt. Price was killed, and most of the men.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[K]</a> Col. Proctor had informed Gen. Winchester he would
afford him an opportunity of surrendering his troops, and
if not accepted he would let loose the Indians on us, who
would burn the town, and he would not be accountable
for their conduct. Gen. Winchester, not knowing how we
had resisted their efforts, thought probably it would be
the case.</p>

<p>But why did not Col. Proctor make this proposition before
he had exerted all his skill in trying to burn the town
and to set the Indians on us? Proctor knew very well
he had done all that was in his power with the force he
had then, and he was then less able to rout us from the
town than he was at first.</p>

<p>The British informed us afterwards that Col. Proctor
had ordered a general retreat to Malden, and that they
had <i>spiked four pieces of their cannon</i>! but he thought he
would demand a surrender, according to custom.</p>

<p>Our officers, knowing that we had but little ammunition,
and the troops being still exposed to the fire of the
cannon, thought proper to surrender.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[L]</a> I was since informed that Col. Elliott instructed the
interpreters to leave the wounded, after dark, to the
mercy of the savages. They all went off, except one half-Indian.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[M]</a> Upon taking a view of these scenes of wo, who can
avoid some such exclamation as the following? Why has
the all-seeing, beneficent Ruler of the universe delivered
so many of our choice officers and brave soldiers into the
hands of our enemies, to be slain in battle, and to lie unburied,
to be dragged away in the galling chains of captivity,
and to be put to torturing deaths by monsters of
cruelty? Not, I presume, because of infidelity and injustice
towards our enemies; but owing to our ingratitude
towards the God of armies; and to our want of confidence
in Jehovah—our pride, our too great confidence in our
own wisdom, valor, and strength; our unbelief—and a
catalogue of vices too tedious to enumerate. Aggravated
national crimes have involved us in heavy and complicated
judgments!</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[N]</a> Here we met a number of the 41st regiment of British
regulars, just from Fort George, going to Malden to supply
the places of those who were killed on the 22d of
January, at Frenchtown. They appeared to be very
sociable, generally of the Irish descent. One of their
officers said, “In a few weeks they would drive General
Harrison and all his army along there.” “Yes,” replied
James Allen<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> (who was one of my messmates), “before
that time your Irish hides will be riddled so that they
would not hold hickory nuts.”</p>

<p>Another of that party said, “What nonsensical things
those leather stocks were which we wore, with the sign
of the eagle pecking out the eyes of the lion.” Said Allen,
“This is only the shadow, the substance will soon follow.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[O]</a> This Allen is the same who fought the duel with Fuller, near Fort
Massac, who was supposed to be a British spy, before the commencement
of the war. Fuller, after having been twice knocked down by
Allen’s balls, was found to have a Dutch blanket folded, and a quire
of paper over his <span class="allsmcap">COWARDLY</span> breast as a shield. Allen was not injured.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[P]</a> Six of us, who formed a mess, stopped at a Major
Boon’s, and asked him “if we might stay all night.” He
said we could. His father, who lived with him, let us
know he had been a Tory major in the American revolution.
He said “he had lived in the Jerseys, and had one
of Lord Howe’s commissions in the house then, and was
a half-pay officer.” He said “the Americans would have
no possible chance to take Canada, for the British next
spring would bring seventy thousand Indians from the
north-west, and as many negroes from St. Domingo, besides
three hundred thousand Turks!” Said James Allen,
“I suppose you will set dogs on us next!” The old fellow
said “it was very evident the Lord was on their
side!” Then said Allen, “If the Lord has joined with
the British, savages, and negroes, to massacre his own
people, it is surprising! But I rather think it is only
your Canadian lord that acts in this manner.” The old
fellow then ordered him out of the house. He told him
“he was very well suited in a room, and would stay till
morning.” They still continued arguing. The old fellow
said “We had no business on their soil,” alluding to
Frenchtown. Allen told him “we were on our own
soil.” He said “it was a lie, for Michigan Territory was
given up to them by General Hull.” Said Allen, “Hull
was such a fellow as the d——l, who offered Christ all
the kingdoms of the world if he would fall down and
worship him; when, poor old sneaking whelp, he did not
own a foot on earth.” Said Boon, “You had better stayed
away, for all you have done; the Major who commanded
the Indians on the 18th was here a few nights ago, and
said there was not one killed, and but three wounded.”
Said Allen, “I would not believe my father if he were to
tell me so, for I saw a number that were killed and scalped
and lay on the snow for days; and if there were but three
wounded, there must have been an abundance of blood
in them to have stained the snow for miles square.” Said
he, “Did you scalp them? you are bloody dogs.” “Yes,”
said Allen, “you might say so, if we had hired the savages
to kill your women and children, and massacre and
burn your wounded, when we had promised to take care
of them.” He said “the British had never hired the Indians
to kill women and children; they were too humane
a people to do so.” “Yes,” said Allen, “they showed
humanity in the time of the American Revolution, when
they paid the Indians for infants’ scalps that were taken
out of their mothers’ wombs; they call themselves Christians,
and when the Indians sent home to them scalps,
from the unborn infant to the gray hairs, in bales like
goods, they had days of feasting, rejoicing, and thanksgiving
to the Lord, for the victory they had gained—the
d——l would be ashamed to acknowledge such a people
as any part of his offspring.” The old fellow again ordered
him out of the house; but Allen told him “he
would go in the morning.” Allen said “we had more
friends in Canada than they had.” “Yes,” said he,
“there are men mean enough to join against their own
country.” Allen replied, “none but a mean, low-lived
wretch would fight against his own country.” The old
fellow took the hint, as he had been a tory, and got in a
violent passion. He asked Allen “if he was not a Congressman?”
Allen said “No.” “Are you an Assemblyman?”
“No.” “Are you a Yankee lawyer?” “No.”
“Well, you are a Yankee liar, then.” Allen said, “if
we were of an age, and on an equal footing, you would
not give me the lie so often.” The old fellow told Allen
“he must be an antediluvian, for he appeared to know
all things that had passed, and all the crimes that England
ever committed seemed to be fresh on his mind; he
supposed he was one of the greatest enemies the British
had.” Allen said “he had done his best; and if he was
exchanged he would shoot at them as long as he could
crook his finger to draw the trigger.” A young woman
who was in the house said “we were only coming to
drive them off their lands.” Allen said “we were only
coming to set them free, so that those lands might be
their own, and not King George’s.” She said “the Americans
that were killed at Queenstown had deeds in their
pockets for all their best plantations.” Said Allen “I
must believe it because you say so, but if I had seen it
myself I would not.”</p>

<p>The old fellow’s passion subsided, and Allen and he
were friendly.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[Q]</a> The second division, who had been used far better
than the first, arrived the day following, and were parolled
in like manner, amounting in all to five hundred
and twelve.</p>

<p>Particular inquiries were made respecting the British
loss in the battle of the 22d, while passing through Canada.
The loyalists stated their loss to be very trifling;
some would say fifteen killed, and others twenty-five.
But different persons, in whom we had reason to place
confidence, stated their loss to be very considerable—about
six hundred killed and wounded, and amongst
these Col. St. George. This account will not be considered
exaggerated, when reflecting on the length of time
they were exposed to a deliberate and well-directed fire
from our troops ... the number that was seen lying on the
ground after they retreated, and the number of sleighs
loaded with their bloody guns.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[R]</a> An inhabitant near the head of Lake Ontario heard
of the prisoners, and went to see them. He began to
talk to one, judging him to be an American officer, and
telling him he had more friends in Canada than the British
had, and if he wanted money, or any assistance, he should
be accommodated. The poor fellow soon found his mistake,
that he was talking to a British officer, just from
Fort George.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
